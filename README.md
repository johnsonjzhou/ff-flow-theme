# Flow Theme for Firefox  

Considered tweaks to enhance the Firefox browsing experience 
whilst remaining true to the vanilla aesthetic.  

Designed with consideration for Vibrancy on Mac OS.  

Written from the ground up through references to Firefox source files at 
[searchfox.org](https://searchfox.org/). 
Written in `scss` and compiled using `webpack`.  

Tested on `Firefox 98.0`.
